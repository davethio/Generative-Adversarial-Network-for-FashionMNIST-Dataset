# Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) Fashion MNIST

## Description
This project implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate synthetic images of clothing items based on the Fashion MNIST dataset. The GAN consists of a generator and a discriminator, trained in an adversarial manner to produce realistic fashion images.

## Features
- Uses a Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN) architecture
- Trained on the Fashion MNIST dataset
- Generates high-quality synthetic images of fashion items
- Implements training and evaluation metrics for GAN performance

## Dataset
- The Fashion MNIST dataset consists of 70,000 grayscale images of 10 different clothing categories.
- Each image is 28x28 pixels.
- The dataset is preprocessed and normalized for training.
